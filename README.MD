# ‚Äé‚Äçüíº HR Analytics: Absenteeism at Work

## Introduction
This project was developed to predict absenteeism at company during work time. This helps in improving decision making by reorganising work process to avoid lack of productivity and increase quality of work.

SQL helps us store and manipulate the data we are working with, and then Tableau enables beautiful data visualization. A well-thought-out integration stepping on these three pillars could save a business millions of dollars annually in terms of reporting personnel.
